# Thesis
This GitHub repository contains the data and code I have used in my thesis Project for the MSc in Applied Data Science at Utrecht University, titled 
"Using LSTM and XGBoost for streamflow prediction based on meteorological time series data" supervised by Dr. Edwin Sutanudjaja, Prof. dr. Derek Karssenberg and Youchen Shen. 

# Notebooks
In this project we used different ML methods including LSTM, XGBoost and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) for two gauging stations including Basel and Lobith. 

# Data
Data is available in the directory called "data" with the follwoing files for each station 
 * observed discharge (m^3/s) obtained from the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC)  plus meteorological driving variables averaged over the upstream grids of the gauging station in csv format
 * simulated discharge (m^3/s) from the PCR-GLOBWB plus its residuals and observed discharge (m^3/s) in flies which states with q in csv format
